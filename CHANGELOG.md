# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- **Thread Safety Enhancement**: Added thread pool state checking in `submitTask()` method
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented proper task completion waiting before thread pool destruction
- **Fixed Mode Thread Exit**: Fixed mode threads now properly respond to shutdown signals
- **Task Completion Guarantee**: All submitted tasks are guaranteed to execute before shutdown
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and state validation

### Changed
- **Destructor Logic**: Completely rewrote destructor to wait for task completion
- **Thread Exit Mechanism**: Improved thread exit logic with proper cleanup
- **Condition Variable Logic**: Enhanced waiting conditions for both fixed and cached modes
- **Result Management**: Fixed result retrieval to prevent data loss

### Fixed
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Resolved potential deadlock in thread pool destruction
- **Task Loss Prevention**: Eliminated possibility of task loss during shutdown
- **Thread Synchronization**: Fixed thread counter synchronization issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of thread resources and containers

### Technical Details

#### Thread Safety Improvements
- Added `isPoolRunning` check in `submitTask()` to prevent task submission after shutdown
- Implemented proper state management throughout the thread pool lifecycle

#### Graceful Shutdown Implementation
```cpp
// Wait for all tasks to complete
while (taskSize > 0) {
    std::cout << "Waiting for " << taskSize << " tasks to complete..." << std::endl;
    // Wait and retry
}
```

#### Fixed Mode Enhancement
```cpp
// Fixed mode now responds to shutdown signals
notEmpty.wait(lock, [this]() {
    return taskQueue.size() > 0 || !isPoolRunning;
});
```

#### Thread Exit Optimization
- Threads now properly remove themselves from the container
- Proper counter updates during thread exit
- Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible

### Migration Guide
- No migration required - existing code will work with enhanced safety
- New features are automatically available

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Features
- Basic thread pool implementation
